# Intro to Data Science Project

## introduction

We are students from VNU-HCMUS, our project is designed to showcase proficiency in the entire data science workflow. We start with the data collection phase, where we demonstrate the ability to crawl and gather relevant data from various sources. This is followed by an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) that uncovers patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset. Finally, we employ modeling techniques to make predictions or draw conclusions based on our analysis.
